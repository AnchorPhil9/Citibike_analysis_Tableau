# Citibikes with Tableau
### Note about Tableau
Due to some **technical mishaps with Tableau Public**, we have opted to use **Tableau Desktop** for this Challenge. Hence, **our work was done on a local Tableau workbook, which we uploaded to this repository.**

## Intro
We were asked by Des Moines stakeholders to conduct an analysis of 2019 bike trips with Citibike to see if bike-sharing is a viable investment or not.
In particular, we were tasked to look for trip durations and biking hours with respect to rider category and gender.

## First Glance
To get a good idea of Citibike's adoption in New York City, we decided to create Tableau plots for the starting and ending stops for bike trips across the city.

  <summary>Citibike Starting Points</summary>

  <summary>Citibike Ending Points</summary>
  
  ![Bike_Ending_points](/Visualizations_images/Bike_ends.png "Bike Ending Points")
</details>

Looking at the two images, while there aren't any disceernible differences aside from color, they nonetheless demonstrate how sizeable the Citibike userbase is,
especially in the likes of congestion-heavy Manhattan. Granted, the hot spots tend to max out at around 16,500 bikers, but that is undoubtedly a good deal of biking
customers to have.
